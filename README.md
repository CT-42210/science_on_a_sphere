makes 8 lights light up on a breadboard to shine into a ball to make the ball change colors

mbed.ccp is the code for mbed

mac_main.py is the file that can control it from my mac

pi_main.py is the file that can control it from the raspberry pi im using. (i know its ironic, controlling a controler from a controler.)

the -basic varients are much simpler, they dont have the customisation features, explanation, or about buttons

i dont have the links to the parts, so im sorry on that front. check "#"s on the py files to figure out how to find the right bus for the usb connector.
